Place all custom page files here....

make sure to start page contents like so:
<pre>
&lt;?php
// This is a check to make sure organizr is setup already...
if (file_exists('config' . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'config.php')) {
    // All variables need to start with $customPage .... Make sure to change Simple to any word (First Letter needs to be capital)... i.e. $customPageNewish
	// Also make sure to escape single quotes
	$customPageSimple = '
        &lt;h1&gt;THIS IS JUST A TEST&lt;/h1&gt;
    ';
}
</pre>
