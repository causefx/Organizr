* default: `null`

### onDropStyle

* type: String
* description: This is the style that is assigned to the row when it is dropped. As for onDragStyle, there are limitations to what you can do. Also this replaces the original style, so again consider using onDragClass which is simply added and then removed on drop.
* default: `null`

### onDragClass

* default: `null`
