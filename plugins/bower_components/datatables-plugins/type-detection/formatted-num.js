/**
 * This plug-in will strip out non-numeric formatting characters such that a
 * formatted number (for example 1,000,000) can be detected automatically and
 * sorted numerically. Note that characters a-z are not automatically removed,
 * otherwise there is a risk of detecting columns as numeric which should not
 * be.
 *
 * DataTables 1.10+ has formatted number type detection and sorting abilities
 * built-in. As such this plug-in is marked as deprecated, but might be useful
 * when working with old versions of DataTables.
