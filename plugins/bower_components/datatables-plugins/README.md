DataTables Plugins
==================

This repository contains a collection of plug-ins for the jQuery [DataTables](http://datatables.net) table enhancer. These plug-ins are feature enhancing for the DataTables library, adding extra options to core functionality such as additional sort algorithms, API methods and pagination controls. The plug-ins should not be confused with DataTables "extras" which are more significant software libraries which add additional features to DataTables.

This repository holds the following plug-in types for DataTables:

* Sorting
  * Type based
  * Custom data source based
* API 
* Filtering
  * Type based
  * Row based
* Internationalisation translations
* Type detection
* Pagination
* Integration scripts
  * Twitter Bootstrap

Each directory has an index.html file which is used to generate the plug-ins documentation on [DataTables.net](http://datatables.net/plug-ins) and describes how plug-ins can be used.
